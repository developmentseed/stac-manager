# STAC-Manager ðŸ“¡ ðŸ“„

## Introduction

STAC Manager allows you to list, create, read, update, and delete STAC collections and items in a web application.

It currently connects to a STAC API via the the [STAC API - Transation Extension](https://github.com/stac-api-extensions/transaction) and can be configured to support standard authentication and authorization flows, if needed.

The application is extendable with plugins to provide user-friendly interfaces for various STAC extensions or custom properties.

The primary intended use is for detail-oriented curation of STAC collections by subject matter experts, for example fine-tuning providers or keywords, adding [STAC Rendering Extension](https://github.com/stac-extensions/render) configurations, or starting a new collection. It does not target the generation and ingestion of large STAC item sets, which is better done programmatically.

We just released this software and are curious to hear about use cases and limitations - please share your experience via this GitHub repository.
